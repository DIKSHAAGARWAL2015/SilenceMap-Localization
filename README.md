# Multi-Region Silence Detection

## Repository Structure
main.py               → Runs the entire pipeline (loading → EEG → beta → graph → GNN → clustering → plots)

dataloader.py         → Loads leadfield & cortex from .mat files

compute_eeg.py        → Simulates multi-region silence, generates EEG, computes SNR

beta.py               → Computes beta values

graph.py              → Builds k-NN graph

gnn.py                → Defines the BetaGNN model used in self-supervised GNN optimization

clusters_ranking.py   → Extracts silent clusters from GNN/Laplacian masks and ranks them by size & compactness

plotting.py           → Produces all visualizations: cortex masks, GNN clusters, beta/g curves

requirements.txt      → Lists Python dependencies

__init__.py           → Marks the repository as a Python package
''
figs/                 → Stores generated figures

## Result inference:

RANK 0 → cluster 2

RANK 1 → cluster 4

RANK 2 → cluster 3

RANK 3 → cluster 1

RANK 4 → cluster 0

## Top clusters (by size & compactness):

  Cluster 2: size=13, mean_dist=12.713, score=1.023
  
  Cluster 4: size=12, mean_dist=13.365, score=0.898
  
  Cluster 3: size=10, mean_dist=13.397, score=0.746
  
  Cluster 1: size=9, mean_dist=13.542, score=0.665
  
  Cluster 0: size=6, mean_dist=12.535, score=0.479
  
size = number of nodes in each cluster, score = size / mean_dist, mean_dist = within a cluster calculated all distances and averaged out.
## 🧪 How to Run

Install dependencies (in a fresh environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```cli
!python /content/SilenceMap-Localization/SilenceMap-Localization/main.py --save_figs --use_mat \
  --leadfield_path /content/sample_data/OT_leadfield_symmetric_1662-128.mat \
  --headmodel_path /content/sample_data/OT_headmodel_symmetric_1662-128.mat
Make sure leadfield and cortex are present
